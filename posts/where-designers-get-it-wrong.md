### Stop trying to be the most creative, the most unique and novel designer! It sounds weird, but it's true.

As designers, we want to wow people because we like to be wowed. We appreciate novel, innovative, unconventional design, so we think others do too. What's worst is now we are trying to wow our fellow designers (see Dribbble.com), so it's warping our intention.

When given a project now-a-days, designers almost immediately start thinking of the most creative way to "up the ante", so to speak, with designing the graphics, colors, icons, buttons … oh, and don't forget to use that crazy, awesome animation that we saw the other day! But wait, hold on, what just happened!?

### We lost our way; we forgot the who, the what and the why.

In the battle to be the most creative, we forgot for whom we are designing, and that is the user. We also forgot what we are designing, and that is the message. Lastly, we forgot why we are designing, and that is because the message needs to be heard and understood.

*Ever since we lost our way, we've been designing from the outside-in.* In other words, we've become focused on how you will design everything but the content itself. This does two things: It neglects the content (the whole reason for the design), and it places emphasis on something that only other designers care about — novelty.

*But, users are not designers,* and at the end of the day, they want a design that is not distracting, uses conventions that are common, text that is big and readable, colors that are high contrast. A designer's mission is to support the user's journey through absorbing and understanding the message, not distract from it. What's the alternative, you may ask?

### Design from the inside-out!

You start with the content within the proper context. What kind of content is it? Is it
serious, exciting, funny? What are we trying to accomplish; what's its primary action? Increase in sign-ups, downloads, donations or just communicate a message?

What kind of audience is going to be interacting with this? How much time do they have? Are they old, young, hip? Will they be accessing this from a mobile device or from a billboard on the highway?

*Warning, the following is very meta:* What is the content trying to tell you, how does it want to be treated, how does it want to be read, what typeface is it begging to be clothed in for it's public appearance?

Once the content informs you of its needs and desires for presentation, you then just listen to it. This focuses you on the right thing, the content, the message. Start with designing just the text and play with typefaces, leading and measure. Then, wireframe it with nothing but the text, minimal lines and whitespace; no colors, textures, photos … nothing else.

Once you get the content designed, then start adding the graphical elements as they are needed. Color schemes, textures, a little depth to differentiate the interact'able elements from the static. But, don't add anything that can't be backed up with solid reasoning. Once you are finished, then re-evaluate what you just did, and remove anything that doesn't have to be there.

### Remember, this journey is not about you, but about the content.

The sheer fact that you are the one designing all of this will influence the design, so don't worry about trying to put your stamp on it. The moment you touch it, you are already guiding the design.

**Bottom line:** design is communication, and the best communication is when the message is clear,
the intent is understood and it is said with the least amount of words, animation and fluff as possible. Don't design the way a politician talks: clouded in fluff, aesthetics and complexity.
