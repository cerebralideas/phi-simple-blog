I hear quite a few people talk about designers as if we belong to a homogonous group all doing the same thing: "making things pretty". I hear UI and UX used a lot to describe a generic web designer, but these acronyms are not synonymous, so this question is a bit flawed. I'm going to attempt to differentiate the different kind of "designers", although I don't believe UX is about design in the traditional sense.

### User Interface (UI) designer:

This person is the *what* designer.

- deals primarily with the visual details, the graphic aspect of applications
- is more commonly familiar with only the static states of applications
- partially responsible for focusing the user's attention on elements
- keeps up with current trends and styles

### Interaction (Ix) designer:

This person is the *how* designer.

- deals with the flow of an application
- handles how the user transitions from one state to the next
- worries about conventions, labels and patterns
- focuses more on the grander aspect of the application as a whole, less on the graphical details (leaves that to the UI person)

### User Experience (UX) practitioner:

This person is the *why* architect.

- quite a few are not "designers", and UX is not just about design
- has his or her hands in every aspect of the product's development
- is more of a coordinator, project manager and director
- they concern themselves with everything from the tone and voice of the copy, the information architecture, taxonomy, to the color and texture of the UI elements
- they focus on research, psychology, testing and advocacy
- the best UX'ers are the ones that constantly advocate for the user
- they ensure that everything is balanced and the experience doesn't lose out to other business interests (bottom-line), department conflicts (we need more advertising space) and other non-user minded things

In the end, a UX'er can be many things, have many skills and come from many different backgrounds. But, the one common thread is that they understand people, what makes them tick, what delights users, is not afraid of research, testing and handling conflicting interests.
