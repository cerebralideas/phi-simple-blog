So, I'm minding my own business, going through my Internets, and I notice this article by [A List Apart: Looking Beyond User-Centered Design](http://alistapart.com/column/looking-beyond-user-centered-design). Then, bam! I'm confronted with a big, pet peeve of mine: User-Experience Design! Ugh, and it's published on one of our industry's leading sites. [sad panda]

Here's a quote from the article:

> The terms “user experience design” (UX) and “user-centered design” (UCD) are often used interchangeably. But there’s an important distinction.

> UX design is the discipline: what we do. Precise definition is elusive, but most attempts focus on experience as an explicit design objective.

The reason the definition is elusive to most is because people like this keep misinforming those that are impressionable and/or outside of the field. "Most focus on experience as an explicit design objective"? What!? Okay, let's just get this out on the table:

*UX is an evidence-based methodology for orchestrating the successful creation and deployment of a product or service that usually involves the oversight of many disciplines. The focus of this methodology is to create a valuable, seamless and frictionless experience for the user.*

It's just semantics right? Why does it matter? Good questions. Let's first start with a little context. 

Our industry is experiencing its late but very welcome heyday. For the past few years, we designers are finally getting recognized for our value and are now being included as an integral part of product and service development. No longer are the days when a bunch of non-designers dreamed up and developed entire products or services without thinking about the impact of design.

In the old days, design was considered the last remaining hurdle to launching your company's new "thing". We would be called in at the last minute and told to make it "look pretty". We would then do what we could to make the god-awful thing usable and pleasing, all the while complaining under our breath about how we were so undervalued.

I believe because of this swing in perceived value, we are now trying to squeeze it for all it's worth, claiming ownership of things clearly outside of our own discipline. Somehow, we snatched up user-experience and stuck our flag in it. Then, all our business cards and websites started to read "UX designer"! That sounds awesome, right?

But, you can't design a user's experience. At least, not in the common sense of the word. I don't care how skilled you are at skeuomorphic button design, or how you can design a whole web-app without a single box-shadow or gradient. What's the common phrase, "putting lipstick on a pig"? 

When was the last time you thoroughly enjoyed using something that was beautiful but pointless? Or, have you ever been swept off your feet by a website riddled with grammatical errors and misspellings? What about falling in love with a well designed app that has a confusing purpose (see [Color for iPhone](http://www.color.com/))?

That's because design can only help reinforce the user's experience of a valuable, usable platform; it doesn't create it, not by a long-shot. Take the mobile app Color from above. Do you think better design would have helped avoid their demise? Of course not.

What's more, the use of UX as some kind of multi-use adjective badly misinforms others. I can't tell you how many HR people have advertised UX designer, UX developer, UX copywriter … Then you have designers attempting to leverage the fad, and their titles become alphabet soup: "Hi! I'm a UI/UCD/UX/Ix designer!"

This degrades the meaning of UX to nothing more than "hipster, pop-sci, cool style design yo!" I actually hesitate to use the term user-experience or UX because it's starting to feel dirty, tainted, faddish.

I can just hear people now: "I gots the mad UX skillz bra! I tickle your right hemi with my nasty heuristicals bb!"

Maybe I should just go old-school on them and use HCI: Human Computer Interaction. At least that actually has some semantic value.
